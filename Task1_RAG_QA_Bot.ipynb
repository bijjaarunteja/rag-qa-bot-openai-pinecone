Coca-Cola has also lobbied against health bills aimed at reducing consumption of their products and has supported organizations that align with their messaging on sugar and public health. The company has been criticized for spreading confusing and misleading messages on a global scale regarding the role of sugar in weight gain and overall public health.\n",

It also discusses the impending legal actions related to accusations of covering up links between sugar-based products and their negative health impact, and how these issues could impact the company's reputation. Additionally, the proposal emphasizes the importance of disclosing financial and reputational risks associated with changing scientific understanding of the role of sugar in disease causation.\n"
